A beginning to become a CS master.

GetCurrentProcessId() 

I think it is necessary to Realize an "adminserver" in one 
month.Meanwhile,the architecture of "simuserver" shoul
d be made clear in one week.The speed of downloading
files in "adminserver" must be accelerated.

learn to create a thread in win.
#include<thread>
thread t1(functionName);
pretty simple.

To accelerate the download speed,I think replace "while"
 with "for" is not helpful.

Just now,I realize that CS master also means a higher 
degree in China.HaHaHa.

Well,I need to understand how to use MUTEX and SEMA
POST,etc.
